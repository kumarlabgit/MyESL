# DrPhylo analysis for detecting fragile clades in an inferred phylogeny from phylogenomic datasets #

DrPhylo investigates major species relationships in phylogenies inferred from phylogenomic datasets. This approach applies evolutionary sparse learning (ESL) to build a genetic model for a clade of interest for a given set of sequence alignments from genes or genomic loci (see citation #2). DrPhylo outputs:
<br />


```
Gene species concordance (GSC)              : A numeric value that identifies gene-species combinations (sequence) harboring concordant ( GSC > 0) or conflicting (GSC < 0) phylogenetic signals. 

Sequence Classification Probability (SCP)   : Classification probability for a species for being a member of the clade of interest.  

Clade Proabaility (CP)                      : Probability (0-1) for the clade of interest. A low value for CP indicates the plausibility of being fragile.  

Model grid                                  : This is a grid representation of the clade model. The rows of this grid represent species with SCP and columns for genes. 
                                              Green       (GSC > 0 )
                                              Red         (GSC < 0 )
                                              White       (GSC = 0 )
                                              Cross mark  (Missing data)

## DrPhylo Analysis ## 

DrPhylo is integrated into MyESL, which can be implemented using the ```--DrPhylo``` flag in MyESL. Therefore, installing MyESL will allow users to implement DrPhylo. MyESL can be installed in the Python environment using the source codes and the instructions below. A user can also use MyESL as a standalone executable software, which does not require installation.    

## MyESL.exe for DrPhylo analysis ##

To run DrPhylo integrated into MyESL, download MyESL using: 

```
git clone -b DrPhylo https://github.com/kumarlabgit/MyESL DrPhylo
cd MyESL

```

## Basic input for DrPhylo analysis using default options ##
DrPhylo analysis in MyESL requires the list of paths for all groups (sequence alignments of genes or genetic loci in fasta format) as a text file and a phylogenetic hypothesis. The phylogenetic hypothesis tested by DrPhylo can be provided using a phylogenetic tree in newick format or a text file containing the hypothesis. 

## Implementation ##

After downloading, a user can perform DrPhylo analysis using the required inputs and other necessary optional arguments.

<br />

```
MyESL.exe alignment_list.txt  --tree phylogenetic_tree.nwk --DrPhylo

OR

MyESL.exe alignment_list.txt  --classes phylogenetic_hypothesis.txt --DrPhylo
```
<br />


#### Required arguments:

<br />

```

alignment_list.txt                       : A text file contains a list of paths for all sequence alignments. For example,
                                           Fungi_data/aln/BUSCOfEOG7B05NR.fasta
                                           Fungi_data/aln/BUSCOfEOG7B05NZ.fasta
                                           Fungi_data/aln/BUSCOfEOG7B05PO.fasta

--tree phylogenetic_tree.nwk             : A phylogenetic tree in newick format with a node ID to construct a hypothesis for the clade of interest.
                                           The hypothesis can also be specified with a separate file using the --classes parameter.
                                           It is highly recommended that the number of species in the clade be equal to or greater than those outside of the clade.
                                           It is also recommended to use the smart sampling option (â€”-balancing) when the number of species inside the clade is greater than the number outside the clade.
OR

--classes phylogenetic_hypothesis.txt   : Requires a text file containing a user-defined hypothesis. It has two columns, which are tab-separated. The first column contains species names, and the second column contains the response value for the 
                                            species (+1/-1). A member species in the clade receives +1 and -1 otherwise. This hypothesis is unconstrained by the tree structure. It is highly recommended that the number of species within the clade of 
                                            interest (+1) is equal to the number of species outside the clade. The hypothesis can also be specified using a separate text file provided using the --response parameter.  

```
<br />	


DrPhylo builds multiple ESL models by performing a ```grid search``` over the discrete sparsity parameters (group and site) space. DrPhylo achieves computational efficiency by early terminating the grid-search process and selecting only multi-gene models. 

DrPhylo outputs a model grid (```M-grid```) and a text file in a matrix format containing the model. A ```M-grid``` is a two-dimensional graphical presentation of the ESL model containing species names with classification probability (rows) and groups sorted by influence (columns).  

#### Optional argumnets:

<br />

```

--lamda1_grid                : This option allows users to set the range for the site sparsity parameter. The site sparsity grid is defined by a string of float numbers min, max, step_size which range from 0 to 1.
                               For example, --lamda1_range 0.1, 0.9, 0.1. This option must be used with --lamda2_range.  

--lamda2_grid                : This option allows users to set the range for the group sparsity parameter. The group sparsity grid is defined by a string of float numbers min, max, step_size which range from 0 to 1.
                               For example, --lamda2_range 0.1, 0.9, 0.1. This option must be used with --lamda1_range. 

--min_groups                 : This option allows users to set the minimum number of genes included in the multi-gene ESL models and helps early stopping in the grid search over the sparsity parameter space.
                               It takes a value greater than zero (0) and builds models containing more or equal numbers of groups in the model.

--class_bal                  : DrPhylo also performs class balancing, a common practice in classification analysis of supervised machine learning. Class balancing helps to make a balance between the number of species inside and outside the focal clade of 
                               interest. Class balancing in DrPhylo is performed by phylogenetic aware sampling <phylo> when the phylogenetic hypothesis is provided by the "--tree" option. DrPhylo also makes a balance between classes by using inverse weights using
                               the option <weight>. 
--output                     : The name of the output directory where all results from DrPhylo analysis will be stored. The program creates this directory automatically. 
```
<br />	

### Model grid from DrPhylo

DrPhylo outputs a model grid of the ensemble clade model along with other numeric outputs like site sparsity scores (SSS), and gene sparsity scores (GSS), etc.,:

```

M-Grid_{clade_ID}.txt : Dataframe containing GSC, SCP, and CP.

M-Grid_{clade_ID}.png : Grid representation of the ensemble clade model using *_GSC_median.txt. This visualization will also contain SCP for all species in the clade of interest.
                                       The taxa with the lowest SCP will be at the top of the grid, and the lowest SCP for the clade is defined as the CP for the clade of interest. 

```
Note: The `{clade_ID}` will be replaced by the text file name when the `--classes` option is used for providing a user-defined phylogenetic hypothesis. In addition, DrPhylo generates summary files of Gene (GSS), Position (PSS), and Hypothesis (HSS) sparsity scores along with species prediction and probability score (SPS_SPP).


## DrPhylo implementation using an example Fungi dataset in Windows ##

After finishing the setup, change the directory to `DrPhylo-master`. To create a text file containing the list of paths for all gene sequence alignments: 
```
cd Fungi_data
for %f in (aln\*.fasta) do echo %f >> aln.txt
cd ..
```
<br />
<br />

DrPhylo analysis for building clade models for two labeled clades, producing a result set for each of two hypotheses generated from the input tree:
<br />
<br />

```
MyESL.exe Fungi_data/aln.txt --tree Fungi_data/Fungi_T1.nwk --DrPhylo --output Fungi_tree_output  

```
<br />

Users can also perform `DrPhylo` analysis for a single clade using the option `--clade_list`:

```
MyESL.exe Fungi_data\aln.txt  --tree Fungi_data\Fungi_T1_with_ID.nwk --clade_list\clade_X1.txt --DrPhylo --output Fungi_out_clade_X1
MyESL.exe Fungi_data\aln.txt  --tree Fungi_data\Fungi_T1_with_ID.nwk --clade_list\clade_Control.txt --DrPhylo --output Fungi_out_clade_Control

```
It is always recommended to keep the number of species in both classes inside and outside the clade the same or at least approximately similar. However, if the number of species within the clade differs from those outside, MyESL provides a way to balance the species count. Two approaches are available: phylogenetically aware subsampling for class balancing and weighting. Class weighting is the preferred method when the number of species within the clade exceeds that outside. 


Phylogenetic-aware class balancing:

```
MyESL.exe Fungi_data\aln.txt  --tree Fungi_data\Fungi_T1_with_ID.nwk --clade_list\clade_X1.txt --DrPhylo --class_bal phylo --output Fungi_DrPhylo_out_clade_X1
```
Class balancing using inverse class weights:

```
MyESL.exe Fungi_data\aln.txt  --tree Fungi_data\Fungi_T1_with_ID.nwk --clade_list\clade_X1.txt --DrPhylo --class_bal weight --output Fungi_DrPhylo_out_clade_X1
```
<br />
DrPhylo analysis using a user-defined hypothesis, producing a single clade model for the given hypothesis:
<br />

```
MyESL.exe Fungi_data/aln.txt --classes Fungi_data/A_B_Hyp.txt --DrPhylo --output Fungi_DrPhylo_A_B_hyp_output 

```
<br />

DrPhylo ensembles multiple ESL models containing at least three (3) genes or more. ESL models with less than three genes are not used for summarization. Users can specify the minimum of genes they want to retain in the models for summarization. A large number reduces the number of models to be used, while a small number increases the number of models to be built. 

```
MyESL.exe Fungi_data/aln.txt --classes Fungi_data/A_B_Hyp.txt --DrPhylo --min_groups 5 --output Fungi_DrPhylo_A_B_hyp_output 

```

In previous examples, DrPhylo produces multiple ESL models using a set of sparsity parameters (lambda1 and lambda2) that range from 0.1 to 0.9 with a step size of 0.1. Users can also define the range of sparsity penalties and step size. DrPhylo analysis for building an ensemble clade model for a user-defined hypothesis using the grid search option. The site and gene sparsity score range from 0.05 to 0.1 and a step size of 0.05:
<br />

```
MyESL.exe Fungi_data/aln.txt --classes Fungi_data/A_B_Hyp.txt --DrPhylo --lambda1_grid 0.05,0.1,0.05 --lambda2_grid 0.05,0.1,0.05 --output Fungi_test_grid_output 

```
<br />

DrPhylo produces multiple numeric outputs and a graphical output. The numeric outputs include different sparsity scores that quantify the association between features (e.g., bits, sites, genes) and hypotheses tested. The model also calculates the hypothesis sparsity scores (HSS), providing overall support for the hypothesis tested. DrPhylo usually produces all these scores in a text file format by default, and these scores are summaries for all ESL models for the clade. However, users can specify which sparsity scores need to be produced by DrPhylo using the option `--stats.` 

DrPhylo outputs only gene and site sparsity scores by using the argument `--stats GS`:

```
MyESL.exe Fungi_data/aln.txt --classes Fungi_data/A_B_Hyp.txt --DrPhylo -- stats GS --output Fungi_test_grid_output 

```

The graphical output is a model grid, with each row representing the species (with normalized classification probability; CP within the parenthesis) within the clade used in the analysis and columns for genes selected by the ESL model. Each cell in the grid is the gene-species concordance (GSC) score. The model grid (M_grid) summarizes all ESL models built for the clade of interest. A positive value for the gsc implies that the gene supports the placement of the species within the clade and is presented in green. In contrast, the negative value indicates discordance, represented by red. Users can modify the grid output by specifying the number of genes and the number of species to be displayed using the option ``--m_grid``. In this case, only a specified number of species from the clade of interest will be displayed and sorted using the classification probability. 

```
MyESL.exe Fungi_data/aln.txt --classes Fungi_data/A_B_Hyp.txt --DrPhylo -- stats GS --m_grid 20,20 --output Fungi_test_grid_output 

```
